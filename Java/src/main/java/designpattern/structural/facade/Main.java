Real-World Use Case: Banking System

Imagine a banking system where various subsystems manage account creation, loan processing,
and fund transfers. A customer doesnâ€™t need to interact directly with these subsystems.
Instead, a BankingFacade simplifies the interaction by providing methods like openAccount(),
applyForLoan(), and transferFunds().
